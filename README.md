Coding Quiz!

https://glenhood.github.io/Password-Generator/

I created a Coding Quiz that tests a users knowlege of coding. The game starts by the user pressing start. Then the user is presented with a series of questions. These questions are times and time deduction occurs if the user answers a question wrong. The game is over when the user answers all the questions or the time runs out. At the end of the game, the user is presented with a score. This score is recorded in the "High Scores" section when the user inputs thier initials at the end of the game.
